# Graphs and network analysis in Spotyfy
This project aims to explore differnt features of different artists in spotyfy, computing some relevant information about them and creating 
some graphs starting from a given artist.

## Graphs_Data
In this folder all the different graphs that are computed during the first 2 sessions as well as the different dataframes are found to
speed up the computations, as they take some time to be computes.

## Skeletons
In the skeletons folder you can find the different functions used during all the project.

## Gephi
In the Gephi folder, you can find the documents used to generate the visualization of the asked graphs, gB and gD.

## General
To end up, the different ipynb with the session contain the code shown in the skeletons but separated, to have an easier exectuion.
Moreover, the Report.ipynb file contains all the code used to obtain the different results for the report and all the questions and
answers for it are found in the following drive document:
